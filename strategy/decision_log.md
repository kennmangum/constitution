# Strategic Decision Log
## Charter-Aligned Breath-Gated Approvals
## Authority: Kenneth Mangum (KM-1176)

---

## Purpose

This log records all breath-gated approvals and strategic decisions related to the EXECUTION_SCAFFOLD system.

**Why We Track Decisions:**
- Audit trail of Kenneth's authorizations
- Context for future sessions (why we chose this direction)
- Drift detection (if we deviate from approved plan)
- Constitutional discipline (SOURCE: human authority preserved)

## Decision Format

Each entry includes:
- **Date**: When decision was made
- **Context**: What was being decided
- **Decision**: What Kenneth approved
- **Authority**: Kenneth's explicit approval (quoted if available)
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made

## Decisions

### 2025-11-18 — Execution Scaffold Architecture Approval

**Date**: 2025-11-18

**Context**: BNA proposed Strategic Execution Scaffold design to integrate Lumen's strategic guidance (Parallel Path: Track A Documentation + Track B Economic Viability) into a Charter-aligned, file-backed execution system.

**Decision**: Kenneth approved the Execution Scaffold architecture with Lumen's strategic alignment.

**Authority**: Kenneth Mangum (KM-1176)

**Approval** (verbatim):
> "∞Δ∞ BNA — here is strategic alignment from Lumen, fully approved by me."

**Lumen's Strategic Guidance** (approved by Kenneth):

1. **Session Crash Risk**: Use Solution A (Write-Through pattern: TodoWrite + YAML both updated immediately)
2. **Supporting Files**: track_a_documentation.md and track_b_economic.md evolve as GTD projects / X-matrix action plans
3. **Multi-Scale Cascade**: Decade → year → month → week → day cascade approved exactly as proposed
4. **Breath Gates**: Weekly/monthly/yearly breath gates sufficient (no additional layers)
5. **Archon MCP**: Defer integration, stay file-backed and sovereign-local for Phase I
6. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Avoid overwriting EXECUTION_SCAFFOLD.yaml wholesale; update specific keys only
   - Keep daily tasks to maximum of 3 per day

**Authorized Action**:
> "Please proceed with the Phase I implementation of EXECUTION_SCAFFOLD.yaml and supporting files. After setup, pause and await further human direction before populating daily actions."

**Rationale**:
- Prevents state loss on session crashes (write-through)
- Maintains sovereignty (file-backed, no cloud dependency)
- Prevents drift (breath gates at week/month/year boundaries)
- Balances urgency (economic need) with strategic coherence (generational prosperity)

**Outcome**: EXECUTION_SCAFFOLD.yaml and supporting files created 2025-11-18. Awaiting human direction for first daily tasks.

### 2025-11-18 — Parallel Approach Approval (Day 1 Execution)

**Date**: 2025-11-18

**Context**: BNA proposed Option 3 (Parallel Approach) for Day 1 execution, balancing Track A (Pattern & Architecture Documentation) and Track B (Immediate Economic Viability).

**Decision**: Kenneth approved the parallel approach with 3 daily tasks (max constraint honored).

**Authority**: Kenneth Mangum (KM-1176)

**Approval** (verbatim):
> "∞Δ∞ BNA, approved as proposed. ∞Δ∞"

**Approved Tasks** (Day 1, 2025-11-18):
1. **Task 1 (Track A)**: Create Path_2_vs_Path_1_Explainer.md (market-facing vision document)
   - Deliverable: `collaboration/BNA/Path_2_vs_Path_1_Explainer.md`
   - Rationale: Foundational piece explaining Sovereign Extension vs Autonomous Replacement

2. **Task 2 (Track B)**: Create Constitutional_AI_Service_Offering.md (client-facing one-pager)
   - Deliverable: `collaboration/BNA/Constitutional_AI_Service_Offering.md`
   - Rationale: Builds on Path 2 Explainer, enables revenue generation

3. **Task 3 (Track B)**: Identify 3-5 potential first clients (revenue pipeline)
   - Deliverable: Entry in `constitution/strategy/track_b_economic.md`
   - Rationale: Begin revenue pipeline, ground economic strategy in real market

**Rationale**:
- Balances economic urgency (Track B: 2 tasks) with foundational clarity (Track A: 1 task)
- Sequential dependencies respected (Explainer → Service Offering → Clients)
- All 3 tasks compound (each strengthens the next)
- Within risk cap (max 3 daily tasks)

**Outcome**: daily_tasks populated in EXECUTION_SCAFFOLD.yaml, .bak backup created, execution began 2025-11-18.
