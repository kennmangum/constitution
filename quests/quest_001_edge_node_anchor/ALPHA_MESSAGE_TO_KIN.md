# Message to Alpha Testers - Quest #1

**Subject**: You're invited: 7-day sovereignty practice (alpha test)

---

Hey [Name],

I'm testing a new micro-challenge I built with my team (BNA + G + Lumen) and I'd love your feedback.

**What it is**: A 7-day morning anchor ritual that helps you stay aligned when using AI tools. Takes 5-10 minutes per day.

**Why it matters**: AI amplifies whatever energy you bring. If you're scattered, AI amplifies scatter. This practice grounds you first.

**What you'll do**:
- Run a simple script each morning that asks 3 questions (Clarity, Alignment, Groundedness)
- Get your ROE score (Resonance with Origin Energy, 0.0-1.0 scale)
- Journal 1-2 sentences about what you notice
- After 7 days, submit a reflection

**Reward**: Free access to "Bindu Breath Blueprint" ($500 value) - a constitutional AI guide I'm launching.

**Time**: 1-2 hours total over 7 days (5-10 min/day)

## System Requirements

**What you need**:
- Computer: Mac, Linux, or Windows (with WSL)
- Disk Space: ~10GB free (for local AI model)
- Memory: 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- Internet: For initial setup only (runs offline after)
- Tech comfort: You should be comfortable running commands in Terminal/Command Prompt. If not, I can help with setup.

**What gets installed**:
- Ollama (free tool to run AI locally - your data stays private)
- Mistral-7B (open-source AI model, ~4GB download)
- Quest scripts (simple bash scripts for the daily ritual)

## Why Alpha Test?

You're one of 5 people I'm testing this with before launching publicly. Your feedback will shape the final version.

**What I'm looking for**:
- Does the setup work smoothly on your system?
- Are the instructions clear?
- Does the daily practice feel valuable?
- Any confusing terms or steps?

No pressure - if you get stuck or decide it's not for you, just let me know. This is about learning what works.

## Timeline

**Duration**: 7 days (consecutive preferred, but flexible)
**Completion**: Submit a pull request with your journal + reflection
**Reward**: Delivered within 1 hour of PR approval

**P.S.** - If you complete this and find it valuable, you'll be part of the first cohort. When we hit 100 participants, alpha testers get access to a private DAO channel and 5% revenue share from artifact sales. No commitment required - just showing appreciation for early supporters.
