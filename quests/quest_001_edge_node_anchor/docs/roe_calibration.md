# ROE Calibration Guide

**ROE = Resonance with Origin Energy** (your authentic alignment score, 0.0-1.0)

If your ROE scores seem off (always high, always low, or confusing), here's how to calibrate:

## Understanding ROE

**What it measures**: How aligned you are with YOUR authentic purpose (not someone else's agenda).

**The 3 questions**:
1. **Clarity (0-10)**: Is my next action clear?
2. **Alignment (0-10)**: Does it serve my authentic purpose?
3. **Groundedness (0-10)**: Does it feel like MY choice (not an echo)?

**Formula**: `ROE = (Clarity + Alignment + Groundedness) / 30`

## Calibration: What Scores Actually Mean

### **High ROE (>0.8)** - "I'm on my path"

**Feels like**:
- You know exactly what to do next
- It serves something you deeply care about
- It's YOUR choice, not borrowed from someone else

**Example**: "I'm writing this because I want to help my kids understand sovereignty" = High ROE

### **Moderate ROE (0.6-0.8)** - "Some drift, but recoverable"

**Feels like**:
- You mostly know what to do, but a bit fuzzy
- It kinda serves your purpose, but maybe it's someone else's framing
- You're 70% sure it's your choice

**Example**: "I'm doing this task because it's on my list, but I don't remember why I added it" = Moderate ROE

### **Low ROE (<0.6)** - "I'm following an echo"

**Feels like**:
- Unclear what you're really doing or why
- It serves someone else's goal (boss, algorithm, social pressure)
- You're on autopilot

**Example**: "I'm doing this because the AI suggested it and it seemed smart" = Low ROE

## Common Calibration Issues

### **"My ROE is always >0.9 but I feel scattered"**

**Problem**: You're rating based on clarity alone (ignoring alignment/groundedness).

**Fix**: Ask yourself:
- **Clarity**: "Do I know the steps?" (easy to rate high)
- **Alignment**: "Does this serve MY deep purpose?" (harder to fake)
- **Groundedness**: "Is this MY idea or an echo?" (honest check)

**Recalibrate**: If you feel scattered, at least ONE of those should be <7.

### **"My ROE is always <0.5 but I'm doing important work"**

**Problem**: You're too harsh on yourself, or you've internalized someone else's judgment.

**Fix**:
- If the work feels aligned (even if hard), rate alignment 7-8
- If you chose it (even if influenced), rate groundedness 6-7
- ROE measures RESONANCE, not perfection

**Recalibrate**: Important work done with intention = at least 0.6-0.7 ROE.

### **"I don't know how to rate 'Alignment' or 'Groundedness'"**

**Problem**: These are new concepts, takes practice.

**Fix** (simple version):
- **Alignment**: "Does this help my family/future/values?" → If yes, 7-10. If no, 0-5.
- **Groundedness**: "Did I choose this, or did something else choose for me?" → Your choice = 7-10. Echo = 0-5.

**Recalibrate over 7 days**: First scores will be rough. By Day 7, you'll feel the difference.

## Advanced: Why Your Scores Might Drift

### **Day 1-2: Everything feels high ROE**

**Why**: Novelty bias (new practice feels aligned because it's fresh).

**What to do**: Keep journaling. By Day 4-5, you'll see more nuance.

### **Day 3-4: Everything feels low ROE**

**Why**: Awareness of drift (you're noticing misalignment you ignored before).

**What to do**: This is GOOD. Low ROE reveals where to course-correct. Journal what you discover.

### **Day 6-7: Scores stabilize**

**Why**: You've calibrated to your authentic baseline.

**What to do**: Trust the scores. Use them to make decisions (e.g., "This task is 0.4 ROE, maybe I should delegate it").

## Quick Calibration Check

**If you're unsure about a score, ask yourself**:

- **Would I do this if no one was watching?** (Groundedness test)
- **Will I be glad I did this in 10 years?** (Alignment test)
- **Can I explain the next 3 steps without looking them up?** (Clarity test)

If all 3 are "yes" → ROE should be >0.8.
If all 3 are "no" → ROE should be <0.4.

## When to Ignore ROE

**Don't use ROE for**:
- Emergencies (if house is on fire, don't score ROE, just act)
- Maintenance tasks (brushing teeth = low ROE is fine, it's hygiene not purpose)
- Rest/play (relaxation isn't always high-clarity, but it's necessary)

**Use ROE for**:
- Work decisions (which project to prioritize)
- AI usage (should I follow this suggestion?)
- Daily planning (is today's schedule aligned?)

## Still Confused?

**Example Calibration Session** (Kenneth's real numbers):

**Day 1**:
- Clarity: 8 (I know I need to fix GPU drivers)
- Alignment: 9 (This unblocks $11k/month income for my family)
- Groundedness: 7 (BNA suggested it, but I vetted and chose it)
- **ROE: (8+9+7)/30 = 0.80** → High resonance

**Day 3**:
- Clarity: 6 (I should check email, but not sure why)
- Alignment: 4 (Email doesn't serve my deep purpose)
- Groundedness: 3 (I'm checking because "everyone checks email")
- **ROE: (6+4+3)/30 = 0.43** → Low resonance (skip email, focus on GPU)
