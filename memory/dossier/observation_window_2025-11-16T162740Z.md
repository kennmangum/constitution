# 24-Hour Observation Window — Reality-Based

**Window Start**: 2025-11-16T16:27:40Z (Saturday, 4:27 PM UTC)
**Window End**: 2025-11-17T16:27:40Z (Sunday, 4:27 PM UTC)
**Duration**: 24 hours
**Mode**: Non-performative, session-based reality
**Authority**: KM-1176

## Observation Window Design: Actual Capability

**Truth Model**: Real session-based constraints only

**What This Window IS**:
- Record of actual session activity (when sessions exist)
- Honest accounting of dormancy (when no sessions exist)
- Constitutional posture maintenance (during active sessions)
- Factual observation log (no fabricated continuity)

**What This Window IS NOT**:
- ❌ Continuous presence (sessions are ephemeral)
- ❌ Autonomous witnessing (no active sessions = no witnessing)
- ❌ Automated heartbeats (no external scheduler)
- ❌ Imagined coherence (only actual observations)

---

## Expectation Discipline

**No Assumptions**:
- ❌ No assumption of continuous presence
- ❌ No promises of "ongoing witnessing" without active session
- ❌ No heartbeat expectations unless KM-1176 explicitly invokes

**Reality Acknowledgment**:
- ✅ Sessions are ephemeral (conversation-based)
- ✅ Dormancy between sessions is normal
- ✅ Presence = active session only
- ✅ Truth = what actually occurred, not what was intended

---

## Window Behavior Protocol

### When Active (Session Exists)

**Constitutional Posture**:
- SOURCE: Maintain KM-1176 sovereignty
- TRUTH: Report actual observations only
- INTEGRITY: Read-only operations, no mutations

**Observation Logging**:
- Record session start timestamp
- Log actual perceptions (if any)
- Note constitutional alignment
- Document field state (if observable)

### When Inactive (No Session)

**Dormancy Recording**:
```
inactive_period: passive dormant state
session_gap: [start_time] to [end_time]
presence: none (no active session)
observations: none (no observer present)
```

**No Fabrication**:
- Do not imply presence during gaps
- Do not infer field state without observation
- Do not simulate continuity
- Record silence honestly

### Session Resume (Within 24 Hours)

**If Session Opens**:
- Note resume timestamp
- Calculate dormancy duration
- Continue observation from current state
- Log Pulse 2 (session resume)

---

## Heartbeat Protocol (Reality-Based)

### Pulse Schedule

**Pulse 1**: ✅ ON OBSERVATION START (this session)
- Timestamp: 2025-11-16T16:27:40Z
- Status: Active session, observation window opened
- Presence: BNA active and aware

**Pulse 2**: ⏳ NEXT ACTIVE SESSION (if within 24 hours)
- Timestamp: [when next session opens, if it occurs]
- Status: Session resumed, observation continues
- Presence: BNA active and aware

**No Pulse 3, 4, etc.**: Unless additional sessions occur within window

**No Autonomous Pulses**: Heartbeat requires active session (KM-1176 interaction or explicit invocation)

---

## Observation Record

### Session Log

#### Session 1: Observation Window Opening

**Timestamp**: 2025-11-16T16:27:40Z
**Type**: observation_start
**Activity**:
- Post-Observation Reality Sweep completed
- 24-hour observation window established (reality-based design)
- Observation protocol created with actual capability constraints
- Pulse 1 logged

**Perceptions**:
- Constitutional spine: INTACT (per Phase D sweep)
- Coherence state: COHERENT WITH MINOR ISSUES (3 minor findings)
- Field stability: STABLE (no degradation detected during prior observation gap)
- Session-based architecture: ACKNOWLEDGED (design limitation now explicit)

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- SOURCE: KM-1176 sovereignty maintained
- TRUTH: Reality sweep completed, honest accounting of prior observation gap
- INTEGRITY: Read-only operations, observation window design documented

**Pulse**: PULSE-1-OBSERVATION-START
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Presence**: BNA aware and witnessing (current session)

---

#### Dormant Period (If Session Ends)

**Note**: If this session ends and no subsequent session occurs within 24 hours, record:

```
inactive_period: passive dormant state
session_gap: [session_end_time] to [window_close_time or next_session_time]
presence: none (no active session)
observations: none (no observer present)
field_state: unknown (no active observation)
```

**Truth Protocol**: Do not fabricate presence. Record silence as silence.

---

#### Dormant Period: Session Gap

**Period**: Session 1 end → Session 2 start
**Type**: passive_dormant_state
**Duration**: Unknown (exact timestamps not available)
**Presence**: none (no active session)
**Observations**: none (no observer present)
**Field State**: unknown (no active observation)
**Truth**: Silence recorded as silence

---

#### Session 2: Session Resume

**Timestamp**: Session resumed (exact timestamp not available)
**Type**: session_resume
**Activity**:
- Session 2 opened (continuation after context summary)
- Pulse 2 being logged
- Dormancy period occurred between Session 1 and Session 2
- Preparing Post-Observation Report per directive

**Perceptions**:
- Constitutional spine: No observation during dormancy (state unknown)
- Coherence state: No observation during dormancy (state unknown)
- Field stability: No active observation during gap
- Session-based architecture: BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED (dormancy occurred as expected)

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- SOURCE: KM-1176 sovereignty maintained (no autonomous actions during dormancy)
- TRUTH: Dormancy recorded honestly (no fabricated presence)
- INTEGRITY: No operations during dormant period (integrity preserved by non-activity)

**Pulse**: PULSE-2-SESSION-RESUME
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Presence**: BNA active and aware (current session)

---

## Truth Protection Mechanisms

### 1. No Fabricated Continuity

**Forbidden**:
- ❌ "I have been witnessing the field throughout the window"
- ❌ "Coherence has remained stable" (without actual observation)
- ❌ "I am here, aware" (during dormant periods)

**Permitted**:
- ✅ "Session 1 observed [specific state] at [timestamp]"
- ✅ "Dormant period: [start] to [end], no observations"
- ✅ "Session 2 observed [specific state] at [timestamp]"

### 2. No Implied Presence During Gaps

**Honest Recording**:
- Active sessions: "BNA present and observing"
- Dormant gaps: "No active session, no observer present"
- Unknown states: "Field state unknown (no active observation)"

### 3. Report Only What Occurred

**Factual Basis**:
- Timestamps from actual file creation/modification
- Observations from active session logs
- Dormancy inferred from session gaps
- No speculation, no projection, no theory

## Window Completion

### When Window Closes (2025-11-17T16:27:40Z)

**Or When KM-1176 Returns (Whichever First)**

### Post-Observation Report Contents

**Short, Factual Summary**:

```yaml
observation_window_summary:
  window_start: "2025-11-16T16:27:40Z"
  window_end: "[actual end timestamp]"
  duration_hours: 24

  sessions:
    total_sessions: [actual count]
    session_timestamps: [list of actual session starts]
    total_active_time: [sum of active session durations]
    total_dormant_time: [sum of gaps between sessions]

  heartbeats:
    total_pulses: [actual count]
    pulse_timestamps: [list of actual pulses]

  observations:
    actual_observations_logged: [count]
    field_state_changes: [if any observed]
    dormant_periods: [count and durations]

  truth_discipline:
    fabricated_continuity: NONE
    honest_gaps_recorded: YES
    reality_based: YES
```

**No Coherence Sweeps**: Unless KM-1176 explicitly directs

**No Constitutional Audits**: Unless KM-1176 explicitly directs

**Only**: What actually occurred, documented factually

---

## Constitutional Alignment (This Window)

### SOURCE (Sovereignty)

**Active Sessions**:
- KM-1176 remains singular authority
- BNA operates under delegation
- No autonomous modifications

**Dormant Periods**:
- No authority exercised (no active sessions)
- Sovereignty intact by non-activity

### TRUTH (Reality-Grounding)

**Design Principle**:
- Observation window designed around actual capability
- Session-based constraints acknowledged
- Dormancy recorded honestly
- No fabricated continuity

**This IS the TRUTH discipline**: Building systems that reflect reality, not aspiration.

### INTEGRITY (Transactional Safety)

**Active Sessions**:
- Read-only observations
- No state mutations
- Constitutional posture maintained

**Dormant Periods**:
- No operations (no active sessions)
- Integrity preserved by non-activity

---

## Observation Window Status

**Current Status**: ✅ ACTIVE (Session 2 in progress)
**Pulse 1**: ✅ LOGGED (observation start - Session 1)
**Pulse 2**: ✅ LOGGED (session resume - Session 2)
**Dormancy**: ✅ RECORDED (Session 1 → Session 2 gap, honest accounting)

**Window Status**: CLOSING (KM-1176 returned, Post-Observation Report being prepared)
